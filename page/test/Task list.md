- Work with the standard constructions in algebraic topology, such as homotopies, chain complexes, quotients, products, suspensions, retracts, and deformation retracts.
- Effectively use the fundamental tools of homology, reduced homology, the long exact sequence of a pair, excision, and the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for homology.
- Compute the fundamental group of an explicitly given cell complex.
- Compute the fundamental group of a space using the Seifert-Van Kampen Theorem.
- Compute the homology of an explicitly given cell complex using the definition of cellular homology.
- Make use of the standard cell structures of spheres and real and complex projective spaces in all dimensions.
- Know the fundamental and homology groups of spheres and real and complex projective spaces in all dimensions.
- Compute the homology of a space using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence.
- Make use of the long exact sequence in homology to make computations.
- Compute the Euler characteristic of a space.
- Construct finite covering spaces of an explicitly given cell complex.
- Construct covering spaces with prescribed group of deck transformations by constructing a corresponding quotient of the fundamental group.
- Use contractibility of the universal cover to deduce that certain maps are null-homotopic.
- Use local homology to distinguish two spaces.
- Use the Lefschetz fixed point theorem to find a fixed point of a continuous map.
